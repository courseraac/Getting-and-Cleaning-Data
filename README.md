# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

The script Run_analysis.R does the following:
  1. Downloads the necessary datasets
  2. Loads the training and testing information, as well as subjects and features
  3. Merges the training and testing datasets to create a single dataset
  4. Extracts only measurements related to the mean and standard deviation
  5. Relabels variables in the dataset
  6. Calculates the averages for the selected variables
  7. Creates a tidy dataset containing the averages calculated in step 6
